# Mixed Messages Project

## Summary
This is my attempt at the first Codecademy project I was given to complete the "Mixed Messages" project. The goal of this project is to randomly generate a message each time the program is run from the command line. In this case, the user receives a category and a trivia questions. After a delay, the answer is provided and the program quits.

## Project Direction
The following details were provided by Codecademy as high level requirements for this project. I'm copying them partly for reference, but also this is the first time I'm writing a markdown file (so good practice!).

### Overview
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

#### Project Objectives
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

#### Prerequisites:
* JavaScript
* Git and GitHub
* Command line

### Setup
You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on your own computer.

For this particular project, you will be using your own text editor (we suggest [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) and [Git version control](https://www.codecademy.com/content-items/74bb71f3f3d5998245e9bbef934502d9). If you need a refresher on how to work with Git for version control, review the [Git lesson](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-git-and-github-part-i/modules/fecp-introduction-to-git/lessons/git-workflow/exercises/git-generalizations) or look at this [cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf). You’ll also want to have [Node set up locally](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-node-locally) to be able to run your script.

### Resource
#### Debugging Tips
Feeling stuck? Try the following:

+ *Google your question*: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Dev.to to see how other folks have found solutions.
+ *Read the documentation*: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using. Oftentimes they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
+ *Rubber ducking*: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.
